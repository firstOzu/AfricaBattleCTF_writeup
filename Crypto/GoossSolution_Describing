This is an interesting chall. My favorite.
First of all by looking at the challenge file and understanding it we see that the code generate five random int number between
0 and 999999999 (a,b,c,d,e). and know that the flag begin with battleCTF...And by looking at the encrypting function and it's output
i got the solve inspiration.

Firstly , we know the b,a,t,l,e letters in the flag ord value(their unicode val). So we can replace them in the encrypton function.
That lead us to a five equation system that i solve in https://www.dcode.fr/elimination-gauss
Then we got the unknown a,b,c,d,e random value and we can write then our decryption solution.(See it at the iLovepython py file and 
the abcdefinding picture).
